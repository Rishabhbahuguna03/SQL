# Let me brief you with 'what this repository is all about?'

- This repository records my progress in the database world using `SQL`.

- Currently, I'm working on a [21 Day Challenge series](https://github.com/Rishabhbahuguna03/SQL/tree/main/SQLWithIDC) by Indian Data Club (IDC) sponsored by DPDzero.

- The challenge encourages regular updates, so I am posting my daily progress on [X](https://x.com/RishabhBahuguna) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Rishabhbahuguna03).

- For this challenge, I am working with [PostgreSQL 17](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-17-released-2936/) as the database engine and [pgAdmin 4 v9.6](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/pgadmin-4-v96-released-3108/) as the interface for managing and reviewing the data. This setup keeps the workflow structured and easy to track.
